When a new record as defined by its unique primary key coming, a new row is added:
    current_ind => true
    deleted_ind => false
    created_ts => NOW()
    deleted_ts => null/empty
    updated_ts => null/empty

for the entire life of this record, the only possible transitions on this record row are
    current_ind => from true to false
    deleted_ind => from false to true

We need to clearly define "update_ts". One definiton is the time when we change the value of either "current_ind " or "deleted_ind"
 
For a record that was deleted and added back again, because we need to update both "current_ind " and "deleted_ind",
the "updated_ts" alone is unable to tell us when this record was deleted.
